For the Kooky Clicker Game. Pomodoro Timer and Mood Check, we used HTML, CSS and Java Script and used conditionals to build the game, we used a Quotable API and used motivational build a survey.

# Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge for us was the fact that all four members of our team were freshmen. Therefore, we were lacking of real-life programming experiences. However, we overcame the challenge by learning the programming languages while building the codes and communicating with teammates to help and teach each others.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We built the site, the game, the survey, and the timer from scratch!
